### ðŸŒŠ Hola! I'm Jose Luis

I'm affiliated with the University of Vigo, working on **Coastal Digital Twins** with a focus on **sea level data integration** using satellite altimetry (SWOT), ocean models (IBI), and in situ observations.

My research aims to develop a scalable framework for harmonizing and visualizing multi-source oceanographic data along the Atlantic Iberian coast â€” contributing to next-generation tools for ocean monitoring and climate-informed decision-making.
